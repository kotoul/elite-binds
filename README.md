# Dahkron's Elite:Dangerous Binds

I'm currently using an Xbox controller with which I first used the advanced joypad configuration, but found it didn't quite do everything I wanted and I still had to reach for the keyboard from time to time.  So I tried using [this guy's config](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=71532) and whilst it's really good I had trouble remembering what was what and it didn't feel entirely logical to me.

So after much tweaking and experimentation I've created my own, based somewhat on the one above (same keyboard binds, for example) and arranged it in a way that is much easier for me to remember and still has everything I could possibly need at my fingertips.

I wondered if other Xbox controller users might be interested in trying it too.

**UPDATE:** I've added a config for the PS4 controller too.

## Rationale

There are three role specific modifier buttons.  ![A](images/a_s.jpg) is for combat, ![B](images/b_s.jpg) is for ui and ![X](images/x_s.jpg) is for utilities.  That way there's one less thing for me to think about and I just know that for example holding A yields combat related actions (targeting, hardpoints, weapon groups, etc).

![Y](images/y_s.jpg) has one single purpose, which is to target ahead.

##### 17/03/15

 * Added a PS4 binds file (thanks to my mate Jon!)

##### 22/01/15

* Moved jettison cargo to ![A](images/a_s.jpg)+![X](images/x_s.jpg)+RThumb as it conflicted with ship lights on the same binding. Ship lights are ![X](images/x_s.jpg)+RThumb. This puts all the 'smuggle' type actions together on ![A](images/a_s.jpg)+![X](images/x_s.jpg).
* Added ![A](images/a_s.jpg)+![X](images/x_s.jpg)+LBumper and ![A](images/a_s.jpg)+![X](images/x_s.jpg)+RBumper to set thrust to 0 and 75% respectively.
* Removed the crosshair.  Sorry, it bugged me.  You can turn it on again by switching on 'Show mouse widget' in the control options after you've loaded the preset.

##### 20/01/15

* Fixed a couple of errors on the diagrams.
